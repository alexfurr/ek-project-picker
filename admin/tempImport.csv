Understanding the synaptic changes in Alzheimer’s Disease in cohorts of human tissue, including those from genetically stratified groups with high risk variants2, will be key to developing symptomatic treatments.  We will use human post mortem tissue to investigate the density of synapse markers using imaging techniques.  Importantly, we will investigate the spatiotemporal profile of the loss of pre- and post-synaptic components.  Initially, immunohistocemical characterisation of synapses will be conducted however more advanced techniques are being optimised in the lab, including imaging mass cytometry, CLARITY brain clearing and two-photon imaging, and may be used in the later stages.  The density of synapses in human tissue has the potential to be compared to synapse density measures in animal models of neurodegeneration3 and link in to extensive synaptome mapping4 of multiple brain regions at different stages of Alzheimer’s Disease.    1.

We have shown that the majority of these variants act via cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (PMID: 32341526). As the primary pathological symptom of the disease is loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, this served as a good validation of the approach of mapping genetic loci onto cell types (as dopaminergic neurons are a type of monoaminergic neuron). We now wish to investigate how the genome is regulated within monoaminergic neurons, such that we can test which features are associated with disease loci.  To do this we aim to obtain single cell epigenetic data from those neurons of humans, using a technique called CUT&TAG. This project will involve collecting and sequencing those cells from post-mortem human brain, and then using LD Score Regression to test for enrichment.","The project will be focused on developing a protocol for enriching dopaminergic neuron nuclei to at least 90%. The experiments will initially be done using mouse, then progress to human post-mortem tissue. We have a set of candidate antibodies which may work for enriching the nuclei, e.g. Pbx1 and En1 as well as antibodies against Tyrosine Hydroxylase which are known to selectively label the cell bodies (but not nuclei) on dopaminergic neurons. The student will use Th as a positive control to test whether they can isolate dopaminergic cells from mouse brain, then extract nuclei from those and test additional antibodies for selectivity. If no antibody provides specific labelling, then a novel method (Probe-Seq) for FACS sorting based on fluorescent RNA labels will be employed.","Development of an enrichment protocol for human dopaminergic nuclei will have broad utility. Specifically, for our lab, it will enable the immediate application of epigenetic profiling of the regulatory landscape in those cells. If the Probe-Seq approach is used, then the enriched nuclei will also be used for shotgun proteomics experiments, to identify candidate proteins which can be used for simpler isolation protocols. At the end, the epigenetic data obtained from the cells will be used to evaluate which regulatory mechanisms within the cell are associated with Parkinson’s disease associated GWAS loci.","In this paper we showed that cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons are genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease:

Current models put forward have suggested several mechanisms for toxicity as aggregates are assembled inside neurons, eventually leading to loss of function and neuronal death. Interestingly, the activity for protein degradation is found impaired in both AD and PD brain samples. There is therefore a plausible link between accelerated protein accumulation with impaired protein degradation, but the exact cellular mechanisms and the phase at which this imbalance occurs is not well-studied. ","We hypothesise that protein aggregation may be delayed or reversed by the enhancing proteasome degradation at the early stages of protein aggregation, while preventing proteasomes to fragment the stable aggregates may be beneficial in the late stages. We will study changes in proteasome activity and distribution in neurons derived from AD genetic background, and determine how proteasomes may be controlled to target and enhance removal of toxic aggregates.

Coagulation is a critical process in the formation of a blood clot after vessel injury. This process must be tightly regulated to ensure that we do not suffer from bleeding or diseases such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism etc. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is one of three main regulators of coagulation. It regulates the initiation phase of coagulation by inhibiting coagulation factor (F) Xa directly as well as its generation. For this to occur, TFPI is completely dependent on protein S and FV, two cofactors that enhance TFPI function. FV sits in the middle of the coagulation cascade and is essential blood clotting. It is mainly known as a procoagulant protein, i.e. it increases clotting. However, it was recently shown to enhance the TFPI anticoagulant pathway and thereby help regulating the coagulation cascade and reducing thrombosis. FV-short is a splice variant of FV which was first described in patients suffering from east Texas bleeding disorder (1). East Texas bleeding disorder is characterised by bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, and haemorrhage following either trauma or surgery. Since FV is a procoagulant protein, the bleeding phenotype in individuals with East Texas bleeding disorder was initially thought to be a direct result of FV-short having lost its procoagulant functions. However, this splice isoform of FV is as good at supporting coagulation as the full-length version of FV. Instead it was discovered that FV-short interacts with the anticoagulant protein TFPI with high affinity. As a result, individuals with east Texas bleeding disorder had approximately 10-fold higher levels of TFPI in plasma, which was the actual cause of the bleeding (1). Following on from this finding it was also found  that FV-short may be up to ~100-fold better at enhancing TFPI anticoagulant function than FV (2, 3). While it was initially thought that FV-short only was present in circulation of individuals with East Texas bleeding disorder, it has also been shown to be present in the circulation of also healthy individuals, although at much lower levels. Due to the high affinity interaction between TFPI and FV-short, the role of FV-short is considered to be two fold, 1) to increase TFPI levels in circulation through their high affinity interaction and 2) to enhance the functionality of TFPI in the regulation of coagulation by functioning as a cofactor. However, the interaction between FV-short and TFPI is not known in detail, neither do we know whether the two proteins need to interact for FV-short to enhance the anticoagulant functions of TFPI. In this study we want to determine through which mechanisms FV-short enhances TFPI anticoagulant functions in detail. ","HYPOTHESIS: FV-short enhances the anticoagulant function of TFPI through a high affinity interaction. 
AIMS: 
1)	Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the TFPI cofactor function by FV-short
2)	Study the importance of the TFPI/FV-short interaction for the TFPI cofactor function of FV-short

Therefore, drugs that disrupt protein breakdown and trigger proteotoxic stress have considerable potential for anticancer therapy. This proposition is supported by the clinical success of inhibitors of the proteasome, the main effector of intracellular protein degradation, in multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common blood cancer.  However, most blood and solid cancers are resistant to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), and even responses in MM are transient. Our lab has been using integrative multiomics approaches (RNA-seq, TMT proteomics, LC-MS metabolomics) to reveal that PIs induce kinetically complex long-lasting effects on amino acid metabolism and the kinase GCN2 (EIF2AK4), which fine-tunes protein synthesis in response to amino acid shortages, may explain why myeloma cells and other cancer cells can overcome proteotoxic stress. from our lab also suggest that limited supply of important nutrients such as glutamine or glucose, which is common in many cancers in vivo, can lead to ‘metabolic re-wiring’ of tumours and alter the cellular effects of proteasome inhibitors. This is important because these metabolic pathways are amenable to pharmacological manipulations. Thus, cancers that are considered resistant to PIs and other proteostasis-targeting therapies could be made sensitive by targeting specific metabolic signalling hubs such as GCN2. Recent studies linking MYC overexpression to increased GCN2 dependence suggest that highly proliferative cancers may be most vulnerable to GCN2 inhibition.","The student will test the hypothesis that solid and haematopoietic cancer cells can be sensitised to PI treatment by pharmacological targeting of metabolic vulnerabilities (i.e activation of serine biosynthesis, sestrin-mediated autophagy, anaerobic glycolysis). The primary aim of the project is to determine the mechanisms by which pharmacological inhibition and genetic depleting EIF2AK4 enhances the toxic effects of clinically available protein degradation inhibitors on cancer cells. Secondary endpoints are (a) to identify the signalling pathways that mediate cell death in EIF2K4-depleted cells and (b) to identify how nutrient limitations (or pharmacologic modifications of glucose and glutamine metabolisms) modify the effects of protein degradation inhibitors on cancer cells. In particular, the student will investigate key signalling pathways that regulate protein synthesis, amino acid and energy metabolism, and the unfolded protein response. ","The findings may lead to a novel approach to targeting cancer metabolism, in conjunction with an ongoing drug development project and bioiformatic approaches to develop a diagnostic tool to predict which tumours are likely to respond to novel inhibitors, based on gene expression signatures.",,"The student will gain expertise in culturing solid and haematopoietic cancer cell lines as well as non-malignant cells such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC).

The lymph node is supported by a vast array of endothelial cells and fibroblasts that provide its structure and promote immune function. Lymphatic endothelial cells support the influx of lymph, which carries antigens and antigen-bearing migratory cells such as dendritic cells, and its distribution into the lymph node that is essential for the induction of immune responses. We have evidence that the expansion of endothelial cells, and specifically the lymphatic endothelial cells, is impaired in ageing, and this project aims to investigate this further. You will analyse existing flow cytometry data and perform immunofluorescence on existing tissue samples to understand the response and localisation of endothelial cells to vaccination, and how this is altered in ageing. You will further develop an in vitro culture system to investigate the signals that induce responses in lymphatic endothelial cells.

All epithelial tissues contain resident cells constitutively binding IgE via the FceRI. Nevertheless, the regulation of IgE responses remains poorly understood and evidence for a role of IgE in host defence is limited. Our lab’s recent work has demonstrated that damage to skin epithelial cells as a result of topical exposure to environmental pollutants, rapidly induces a unique IgE response, which potently affects the susceptibility to epithelial carcinogenesis [1-3]. Based on these findings, and that expression of FceRI correlate with good prognosis and survival across many human cancers, we now hypothesise that IgE and FceRI+ effector cells confer host-protective tumour-surveillance in human skin. We thus aim to identify IgE-elicited pathways and the mechanism(s) utilised to promote human tumour immune-surveillance. Results will define how IgE mediates its host defence role and will guide future manipulations of the powerful IgE-FceRI axis for immunotherapy. Results may additionally uncover how ‘unwanted’ allergic pathophysiological IgE responses can be regulated.","The overall aim of the research project is to understand how the IgE-FceRI axis provides tumour-protective immunity. We will explore the mechanism(s) driving the IgE-mediated host-protection and characterise the spatial localisation of IgE effector cells in human cutaneous squamous cell cancer (cSCC). Specifically, we will address the following key questions: 
1)	Where in cSCC do IgE-FceRI bearing cells locate?
2)	Are there distinct effects of IgE-crosslinking on different FceRI-expressing cells?
3)	How does IgE-crosslinking affect epithelial cells growth?
","The student will develop immunohistochemistry methods to stain for FceRI and cell-specific markers in sections of human cSCC. This will be the initial steps as our lab develops techniques for high-multiplex imaging and single-cell protein analysis using Imaging Mass Cytometry (Hyperion). The student will simultaneously participate in developing these advanced techniques and time-allowing, will move to imaging mass cytometry during autumn/winter.

In addition to imaging, a large part of the project will be using human blood to assess the differential impact of IgE/FceRI-crosslinking on the variety of human cells that express the FceRI receptor (basophils, dendritic cells subsets, eosinophils and monocytes). Cells will be assessed for activation markers, degranulation, cytokine expression, growth factor release etc). We will also assess whether cells following activation via the IgE-FceRI axis stimulate growth, or death, of epithelial cells and whether they activate other cells (e.g. T cells).

Interest in the contribution of CD8+ T cells to SLE’s pathogenesis is growing, as SLE patients display CD8+ T cell abnormalities and a CD8+ T cell signature predicts prognosis. Data from our laboratory using an inducible model of SLE (known as chronic graft-versus-host disease, cGvHD) demonstrate that CD8+ T cells expressing the NK cell activating receptor, NKG2D, play an important role in the maintenance of disease and the production of autoantibodies.   NKG2D recognizes a family of stress-response ligands called NKG2D ligands (NKG2D-Ls).4 NKG2D-Ls are hardly expressed on healthy tissues but are upregulated in response to different forms of cellular stress. Preliminary investigation of transcriptomic data suggests that NKG2D-Ls are upregulated on several immune cell types in SLE patients with active disease. In addition, genetic studies have shown an association between NKG2D and NKG2D-L (e.g MICA) polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility. Furthermore, analysis of the expression of the mouse NKG2D ligand Rae-1 (homologs of the human MICA protein family) in our cGvHD model suggests that a small proportion of B cells express Rae-1. We therefore aim to characterize the expression kinetics and location of NKG2D-Ls within the cGvHD model using multiple approaches. Specifically, we intend to identify the location of NKG2D-L expression by organ and by specific cell type(s) (e.g., B cells). Understanding the location and specific cell types expressing NKG2D-Ls can help untangle the mechanism underlying the contribution of CD8+ T cells to the pathogenesis of SLE.

There are currently no cures for OA, and no effective pharmacological treatments exist that slow or halt its progression. OA treatment is currently limited to steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which provide symptomatic relief for pain and inflammation. So there is a strong urgency for a drug able to halt disease progression and improve the quality of life of OA patients. Recently, considerable effort has been put on the discovery and development of drugs able to slow down or halt the progression of OA, i.e. disease modifying osteoarthritic drugs (DMODs). OA is characterised by destruction of articular cartilage and this is mediated by proteases called ADAMTSs which cleave aggrecan, the major proteoglycan in the tissue. My lab has an extensive experience in developing and characterising this novel class of therapeutic reagents, having developed both monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of ADAMTS proteases. The student will be based in my research group, where we investigate how DMODs protect from cartilage degradation in an experimental model of OA.  This is a chondrocyte-monolayer assay for aggrecan degradation. Primary human OA chondrocytes will be plated in 24-well plates in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% Foetal bovine serum. To evaluate aggrecanolysis, chondrocytes will be rested for 24 h in serum-free medium then cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, two inflammatory cytokines known to stimulate expression of ADAMTS and subsequent cartilage degradation. Bovine aggrecan, representing the ADAMTS substrate, will be then added. The effect of anti-ADAMTS monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors and TIMP3, the endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTSs, on aggrecan degradation will be evaluated. Conditioned media will be collected for analysis of specific ADAMTS-generated aggrecan cleavage fragments by immunoblot and ELISA.",We hypothesise that inhibition of ADAMTS proteases prevents aggrecan degradation in this experimental model of inflammatory OA.,The student will identify novel molecules with inhibitory activity against ADAMTS proteases which will prevent aggrecan degradation.

Rejection, in particular antibody mediated rejection (AMR) represents a significant barrier to allograft survival. Donor specific antibodies (DSA) can arise in the recipient prior to transplant via pregnancy, prior transplantation and blood transfusion or de novo post-transplant. DSA target and activate allograft endothelial cells, which plays a critical role in promoting microvascular inflammation by leukocyte recruitment, lymphocyte activation and differentiation and secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Current treatment strategies involve potent immunosuppressive protocols, with the adverse side-effect profile of corticosteroid use well-documented, and there is urgent need to identify more specific and safer therapies. TLR receptor and inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, have a pivotal role in the augmentation of microvascular inflammation in ABMR.

Cultured immortalised human glomerular endothelial cells (ciGEC) will be stimulated with TLR agonists, IL-1 and anti-HLA antibodies with or without complement, modelling human disease. Expression of IRAK1, IRAK4 and their phosphorylated isoforms will be detected by Western blot. Proinflammatory cytokine production will be assessed by ELISA. Expression of adhesion molecules will be assessed by flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of genes associated with endothelial activation will be carried out. Expression levels will be compared between experimental conditions. The effect of pharmacological inhibitors of IRAK 1/4 will be compared with controls. The specific role of IRAK1/4 will be further validated using siRNA.","IRAK1/4 are induced and activated in activated glomerular endothelial cells, and are crucial in mediating renal allograft injury. ",The results from this study will provide the scientific basis for developing a clinical trial of IRAK 1/4 inhibitors in antibody mediated renal transplant rejection ,"1.

LIT01,Cecily Donnelly,c.donnelly19@imperial.ac.uk,Brain Sciences,Literature Based Research Project (LITP),,Psychiatry,Exploring the relationship between eating disorders and mentalisation,Eating Disorders,Autism,Anorexia Nervosa,Mentalisation,Mental health,"Mentalisation (or reflective functioning) is the capacity to understand others and ourselves through reflecting on mental states, including feelings, beliefs, wishes and goals. This cognitive process allows humans to understand behaviour and navigate the social world. This is conceptualised differently from autism traits as it is believed that some aspects of reflective functioning can be learnt, while autism traits may be fixed. Reflective functioning is an important correlate of a variety of mental disorders in adults, including eating disorders. Recent research has also suggested that the ability to mentalise is an important protective factor against severe mental health problems. It is not yet clear the extent to which reflective functioning is a plastic construct that can be influenced by therapy and the environment, compared to autism spectrum disorders. Puberty is a key time for the development of reflective function, as the young person is under the influence of a range of pubertal hormones. However, starvation interrupts these developmental processes, making it difficult to know whether any deficits in reflective functioning are a predisposing factor (trait) or a consequence of an eating disorder (state). 
Eating disorders are complex and potentially dangerous mental health conditions, associated with a variety of harmful behaviours. These behaviours include bingeing, purging and dietary restriction, amongst others. Current treatments for eating disorders remain woefully insufficient for some young people and prognosis can be poor, with a high mortality rate. It is well established that early intervention is important to have the best chance of creating change before there has been potentially irreversible effects. 
The student will be based in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Research group, which is headed by Dr Dasha Nicholls. The group consists of a mixture of academic researchers and mental health clinicians engaged in research.
There are a number of projects that students can get involved in within the area of eating disorders and mentalisation including:
•	A systematic literature review evaluating hypermentalising in young people.
•	A systematic literature review examining the tools used to measure social communication deficits in young people.
•	Secondary data analysis on a dataset examining mentalisation in parents of children with eating disorders.
•	Secondary data analysis on a dataset examining disordered eating behaviours and social communication deficits amongst school children.
•	There is also potential for students to design their own survey studies. These would be extensions on current ethics applications.
","Specific research problems and hypotheses will be refined between the supervisor and the allocated student closer to the start of the project. However, in line with my academic interests, the research question must be related to mentalisation in young people, and the relationship with disordered eating behaviour. ","The student will have the opportunity to present their research at various points, including to clinicians within the eating disorder and psychiatric worlds. It is also hoped that the student will be able to publish the project within an academic journal and contribute to other research activities within the research group.","Katznelson, H., 2014.

We have shown that the vast majority have strong neutralising antibody titres out to at least 4 months, that these tend to correlate with the presence of CD4 T cell responses to spike epitopes, but also, that there is a considerable degree of uncoupling between T cell and antibody responses – individuals in our cohort often showed one without the other.

To date and because of the need for speed, many reports have been relatively superficial in their fine-mapping of antiviral T cell responses, either in terms of epitope or in terms of responder cytokine profile correlated to disease phenotype. SARS-CoV-2 expresses a large proteome of potential T cell epitopes, most of these still poorly mapped. In this project there will be a chance to get involved in this work, characterising in silico the epitope and cytokine profiles of responder T cells.

Although highly infectious the consequences of COVID-19 disease vary from asymptomatic, to short –lived but unpleasant illness to severe respiratory failure carrying a high mortality. At the start of the pandemic in the UK there appeared to be equal danger to all but quickly the severity of disease stratified to increased severity for older males, those with key underlying conditions (COPD, immunosuppression, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus) as well as increased weight, and non-white ethnicity. Lockdowns have been a major tool in reducing transmission but have negative social (e.g. on mental health, loneliness, isolation) and economic consequences too. Currently the risk of death for those under 35 is low, so much of the isolation is to protect older and other vulnerable individuals i.e. of more public health rather than personal benefit. In many younger groups it is fair to say that the individual risk of severe disease is limited so maintaining controls is motivated more by altruism than fear. 
Longer term, a return to normality depends on the successful development and deployment of a vaccine.
We want to understand the extent of vaccination hesitancy in students, why, and if this persists, dissipates, or develops later so that we can develop the most appropriate strategies to combat it. We aim to implement a study in medical students (at Imperial College) and under and post-graduate nursing students (at City University) into attitudes to vaccination and vaccine hesitancy, with a particular emphasis on COVID-19 vaccination). The study will also help us determine the potential role of education during under and postgraduate medical and health training.
Dissemination: The findings of the survey will be made available, open access on the Imperial College ARC website: www.imperial.ac.uk/arc;scientific papers in peer-reviewed academic journals; presentations at regional conferences; local seminars.
Impact/Benefit: As the vaccine has been produced in a compressed time-frame there is evidence that the public and Healthcare workforce may not be as keen as expected to receive the vaccine., it is important to understand perceived benefits and any reasons which might prevent individuals from taking up the vaccine . The planned vaccination campaign for NHS staff in particular, needs to be efficient and has limited time for delivery so this understanding will enable better planning with carefully targeted campaigns to improve uptake.
Emerging evidence suggests that, despite the morbidity and mortality associated to SARS-CoV-2 and the impact on the health and social care system, a proportion of the population, including healthcare workers’, might  be reluctant to accept covid vaccination. However, although there is widespread evidence of vaccine hesitancy in general, the situation is more fluid and dynamic than previously realised. For example, in a global monitoring study of attitudes to vaccine confidence in general mapped across 149 countries between 2015 and 2019 (284 381 individuals) confidence has fluctuated in different countries.
. 
","This study has the overarching aim of conducting a survey about attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination in medical students at Imperial College and a matching study in nursing students at City University. Our aims are to define the proportion of medical and nursing students who are hesitant about being vaccinated; identify some of the underlying reasons why they are reluctant; use this to develop strategies to improve vaccination rates. It would be very helpful to understand to what extent vaccination hesitancy is prevalent as students , why, and if this persists, dissipates, or develops later so that we can develop the most appropriate strategies at the right time.

","The primary objectives of the study are to:  •	Understand perceptions about COVID-19 vaccination  •	Understand perceptions to COVID-19 vaccination compared to other vaccinations  The secondary objectives of the study are to:  •	Test different vaccination messaging scenarios ",,
